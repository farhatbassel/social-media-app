# Social Media App

# What to expect

The following is a website that I creating using React. I also created an API to handle different requests, such as users/authantication/posts/messaging.

It is divided into multiple sub directories, where I tried to implement best practices.

Some of the features of the website (which can be seen in the videos below) are creating /login into an account, adding/ liking posts, following/ favoriting users, messaging with other users.

## Technologies used:

- React
- Material UI
- Express
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- SocketIO
